# CSIT128-Individual-Assignment

For this assignment, I was assigned to completely code a three-page website showcasing different aspects of my life and interests in under two hours, given that I had time to plan out the website design and pick images beforehand.

The first page provides a brief introduction about me, including my hobbies and recent projects. On the second page, I share highlights from the various places I've visited, complete with descriptions and photos. The final page features a contact form, enabling visitors to get in touch with me easily with the use of their mail client.
